Gamescope install script
 
A simple set of scripts to download, install and delete gamescope on linux.

Gamescope is an open-source micro-compositor primarily designed for Linux gaming and enhanced graphical performance. Originally developed by Valve, Gamescope allows for features like screen scaling, forced resolution, and improved frame pacing by controlling how applications are rendered and displayed. This is especially useful for games, providing smoother gameplay, better FPS (frames per second), and compatibility with multiple display resolutions without altering game settings directly.
